# snowpack

Use [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), "a lightning-fast frontend build tool, designed for the modern web", to build a simple payment form with Square Web SDK.

## How to use

Clone, install, and start:

```sh
# clone from github
git clone https://github.com/square/web-sdk.git
# go to example
cd examples/snowpack
# install dependencies
npm install
# start development server
npm start
```

Snowpack will open `index.html` which includes `pay.js` where Square Web SDK is set up to take a card payment.
